## üåå What is this?

**create-universal-app (CUA)** is an opinionated template for creating full-stack universal (mobile + web codeshare) apps with built-in auth for both mobile and web using **Expo** (mobile), **NextJS** (web), **tRPC**, **Prisma**, **Tamagui** (UI + styling), and **Clerk** (mobile + web auth). A **demo** is live at <https://cua-demo.vercel.app/>.

[Here's](https://youtu.be/aTEv0-ZBbWk) a 20 minute Youtube tutorial going over everything if that's more of your style!

You can also run `npx create-t3-universal-app` to start your project! (by [albbus](https://github.com/albbus-stack/create-t3-universal-app))

If you have any question while using this, feel free to join our [üëæDiscordüëæ](https://discord.gg/5HvtckjyYb), we are all pretty active in there!

**This repo is made on top of**:

- [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo): expo, next, trpc, prisma, nextauth - no UI code share & no mobile auth.
- [t3-turbo-and-clerk](https://github.com/clerkinc/t3-turbo-and-clerk): t3 turbo with auth for mobile + web - still no UI code share.
- [tamagui + solito starter](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/starters/next-expo-solito): expo + next code share - no tRPC & no built-in auth.

## üåü How it works

### Folder Structure

- **apps**
  - next
  - expo
- **packages**
  - ui (your reusable components with tamagui)
  - db (db schema & prisma stuff)
  - app
    - features (‚≠êÔ∏è all of your native frontend code will go here ‚≠êÔ∏è)
    - navigation (unifying web + mobile navigation)
    - provider (unifying providers)
    - utils (your utils like auth & tRPC)
  - api (all of your tRPC & backend code)

### In a bit more detail

Your **frontend** code will be in React Native, meaning that you're going to write Views instead of divs. Since we are using Tamagui in particular, we're gonna write Stacks instead Views.

- `apps/expo` and `apps/next` are practically empty folders that are simply _referencing_ your `packages/app` folder.
- If you're familiar with React Native, it's going to feel as if you're writing a React Native app, that just happens to also run really well on the web (with SSR and all of those goodies).
- Your code will get rendered as HTML/CSS on the NextJS side and normal React Native on the native side.

Your **backend** code is gonna be in `packages/api`. NextJS is going to run this code in a serverless environment, if you're a little confused about how that works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cB5Fh46Vi4&t=1017s)'s a good video by Theo that talks about NextJS as a backend framework.

- Your backend and frontend will communicate with tRPC.
- Your backend and your DB will communicate with Prisma (ORM).
- Mobile auth is done with Clerk Expo, and web auth is done with Clerk React and Clerk Next.

_Note: you don't need to understand how everything works in detail before you can start using this template. As someone that wants to know how every bolt and nut works, I often get "blocked" by my own perfectionism, so I'm just throwing this out there in case you're feeling the same about something._

## üí≠ Behind the decisions

### Why Tamagui for UI & styling?

#### _What is Tamagui?_

_TLDR_: it's for making things look pretty on both web and mobile while being really really fast and easy to work with. In more detail, Tamagui has 3 things:

- **Compiler**: their unique way of turning your _"style related code"_ into pure CSS faster. Most important thing here is probably the tree flattening thing they do.
- **Core**: a small set of components they built aimed to replace View and Text that you use in React Native, with some advantages.
- **UI**: a set of UI components that the Tama team built using Core.

Check out their [docs](https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/introduction) for more informations.

#### _Why not Nativewind & Tailwind?_

What I like about Tamagui is that it's simultaneously Tailwind and DaisyUI that's built from the ground up designed for universal apps with its own compiler and core components.

Feel free to use Nativewind & Tailwind instead of Tamagui, you should be able to set things up fairly easily (and if you do _please_ contribute to this template creating a branch with the Nativewind installation).

### Why Clerk for auth?

On a high level, clerk promises an overall user management solution instead of just authentication with things like the User Profile, Banning and Device management built-in. In practice, they have a very similar Expo/Next library with built in Hooks that are very nice to use! I've personally had an great time using Clerk compared to other solutions like Firebase or Supabase.

#### _Practical things_

- Really nice hooks & components (SignedIn/SignedOut) that work for both Expo and NextJS.
- SDKs for all 3 platforms: Expo frontend, NextJS frontend, NextJS serverside.
- Fantastic support and help from their team on Discord(from personal experience).

#### _Downsides_

- Doesn't do SMS unless you pay: big negative for mobile but makes up for it with easy oauth.
- Premium plan expensive compared to the alternatives.
- Double edged sword of being a startup.

### Which DB?

I recommend you either spin up a Postgres instance on Railway or use Supabase, you can bring your own as it doesn't matter too much.

## üî® How to use this?

### 1. Set up project

- `pnpm install` to install packages and build the project.
- Set up your environment variables properly by duplicating the `.env.example` file, removing `.example`, and entering your environment variables.
  - **CLERK_SECRET_KEY** & **NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**: sign up on [clerk](https://clerk.dev/) to get your API keys
  - **DATABASE_URL** (**optional**): spin up a Postgres instance with Railway or Supabase (we're using SQLlite by default now, so you don't have to do this unless you're ready for production!)
- `pnpm run db-push` to push our Prisma schema to our DB.

### 2. Start up your project

- `pnpm run web` to start a web dev server.
- `pnpm native` to run on iOS or Android. **PS**: for this to work, you'll need your web app running on localhost:3000, remember that your NextJS app is also your backend!
- `pnpm run studio` to start up your Prisma Studio. **PS**: the tRPC query will show nothing unless you manually open up Prisma and add a "post", or query an user info in the DB!
- `pnpm run dev` to start up all packages and applications simultaneously.

### 3. Adding a new screen

To automate the process explained below you can use the VSCode extension [t3-cua-tools](https://github.com/albbus-stack/t3-cua-tools), also available on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=albbus-stack.t3-cua-tools). It will create the files and add the necessary imports and navigation code for you.

- Create new screens in `packages/app/features/`.
- For smaller components feel free to put them in `packages/ui/`.
- For new routes add a new `routeName.ts` in `packages/api/src/router/` and make sure to merge it in the `index.ts` app router.
- When you add a new page or screen, you'll need to add the page into both Expo and NextJS:
  - **Expo**
    - Go to `apps/expo/app/` and create a new `routeName.tsx` that's importing your element from `/app/features/screenName/`.
  - **Next**
    - Go to `apps/next/pages/`, create a new folder with the name being your route and an `index.tsx` that's importing your element from `/app/features/screenName/`.

## Deploying to Vercel

After you have created a new project on Vercel and linked it with your Github repo you'll have to enter your environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`

(ignore the install command one now)

## FAQ

1. **Where should I install the packages?**
   If it contains native code you must install it into the `/expo` folder.

2. **How do I know if it contains native code?**
   In general if it involves some interactions with the phone OS like the APIs to interact with storage, camera, gyro, notification, etc. it involves native code!
